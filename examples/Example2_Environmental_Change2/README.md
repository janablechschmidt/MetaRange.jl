# Environmental change

A dynamic example using v2.1 Bioclimate from CHELSA and their projections for climate change under the SSP-RCP7 using the gfdl-esm4 model using the region of Bavaria. Data was downscaled by a factor of 10 to reduce the size of the files. This results in a patch size of about 100 km². The original data can be downloaded from [CHELSA](http://chelsa-climate.org/downloads/)[^1]. To keep it small the amount of time for global warming accelerated 40 years. The original dataset spans from 1979 to 2100.  
The used species is [*Orchis militaris*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchis_militaris) which is also included in the publication (Blechschmidt et al.)  
For further information on how to run simulations with a dynamic landscape refer to the [usage](https://janablechschmidt.github.io/MetaRange.jl/dev/usage/) section of the documentation.
